OUTLIER DETECTION REPORT
========================

DETECTION RULES:
• Normal values: Within ±2 standard deviations
• Moderate outliers: 2 to 3 standard deviations away
• Extreme outliers: Beyond ±3 standard deviations

EPA MILEAGE DATA:
Mean ±2 SD: [ 32.1 ,  41.7 ] mpg
Mean ±3 SD: [ 29.7 ,  44.1 ] mpg
Result: No outliers detected in EPA data

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
• Quality control: Flag products outside normal ranges
• Data cleaning: Identify potential measurement errors
• Research: Detect unusual subjects or responses
• Grading: Identify exceptional performance (high or low)

RULE SELECTION:
• Symmetric data: Use Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7)
• Skewed data: Use Chebyshev's Rule (safer, broader)
• Unknown distribution: Always use Chebyshev's Rule
