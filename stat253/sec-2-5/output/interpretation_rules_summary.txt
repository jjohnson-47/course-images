CHEBYSHEV'S RULE (Any Distribution):
• At least 0% within ±1 SD
• At least 75% within ±2 SD
• At least 89% within ±3 SD

EMPIRICAL RULE (Mound-Shaped Only):
• Approximately 68% within ±1 SD
• Approximately 95% within ±2 SD
• Approximately 99.7% within ±3 SD

WHEN TO USE WHICH:
• Chebyshev's: Always safe, any data shape
• Empirical: More precise, but only for bell-shaped data
