VARIABILITY ANALYSIS REPORT
===========================

1. EPA MILEAGE DATA:
   Mean: 36.88 mpg
   Standard Deviation: 2.4 mpg
   Interpretation: Cars typically get 36.9 ± 2.4 mpg

2. KEY INSIGHTS:
   • Standard deviation is in original units (mpg, dollars, etc.)
   • Larger SD = more variability
   • Range can be misleading with large datasets
   • Variance uses (n-1) for unbiased estimation

3. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
   • Quality control: Lower variability = more consistent products
   • Risk assessment: Higher variability = more risk
   • Performance evaluation: Consider both average AND consistency
