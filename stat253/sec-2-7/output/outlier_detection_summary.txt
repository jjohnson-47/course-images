OUTLIER DETECTION METHODS SUMMARY
=================================

BOX PLOT METHOD:
1. Calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR
2. Inner fences: Q1 ± 1.5×IQR, Q3 ± 1.5×IQR
3. Outer fences: Q1 ± 3×IQR, Q3 ± 3×IQR
4. Mild outliers: Beyond inner fences
5. Extreme outliers: Beyond outer fences

ADVANTAGES:
• Visual method
• Robust to existing outliers
• Based on quartiles (not affected by extreme values)

THREE CAUSES OF OUTLIERS:
1. Measurement error (investigate and possibly remove)
2. Different population (investigate context)
3. Rare event (legitimate, keep in analysis)
