OUTLIER DETECTION METHOD COMPARISON
===================================

DATASET: Gas Mileage (n =  100 )

BOX PLOT METHOD RESULTS:
Mild outliers: 30, 44.9 
Extreme outliers: 30, 44.9 

Z-SCORE METHOD RESULTS:
Possible outliers (|z| > 2): 30, 44.9 
Outliers (|z| > 3): 30, 44.9 

AGREEMENT:
Identified by both methods: 30, 44.9 

RECOMMENDATION:
Use box plot method for exploratory analysis and robust detection.
Use z-score method for precise numerical criteria with normal data.
