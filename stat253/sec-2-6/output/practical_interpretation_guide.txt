PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION GUIDE
==============================

PERCENTILES IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS:

1. STANDARDIZED TESTS (SAT, GRE, etc.):
   • 99th percentile: Elite performance
   • 90th+ percentile: Excellent, competitive for top programs
   • 75th+ percentile: Good, above average
   • 50th percentile: Average performance
   • Below 25th: May need additional preparation

2. GROWTH CHARTS (Medical):
   • Above 95th percentile: Monitor for abnormal growth
   • 25th-75th percentile: Normal range
   • Below 5th percentile: May need medical evaluation

3. EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE:
   • Top 10%: Promotion candidates
   • 75th+ percentile: High performers
   • 25th-75th: Average performers
   • Bottom 10%: Performance improvement needed

REMEMBER:
• Percentiles show relative position, not absolute quality
• Same raw score can mean different things in different groups
• Z-scores allow comparison across different distributions
• Always consider the context and reference group
